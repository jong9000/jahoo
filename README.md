# jongslist

A personal nod to YAHOO's now defunct directory of the internet. Built with HTML/CSS (no JS) and with GitHub's online editor. 

#### Go to the live directory [here](https://jong9000.github.io/jongslist/).

### CSS 
- [Primitive UI](https://github.com/taniarascia/primitive) - by Tania Rascia

### Inspiration
This directory itself consists of links to the people and sites that have inspired me or I've found to be interesting. Read more about Yahoo's directory [here](https://searchengineland.com/yahoo-directory-close-204370).
